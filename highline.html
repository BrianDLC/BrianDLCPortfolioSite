            <p>The High Line begins in W 34th st. between 11th and 12th ave, it's around 1.45 miles long and ends on the corner of Washington St. and Gansevoort St. in the lower west side of Manhattan. It was a over the street railway line that was converted into a public open space completely by late 2014. Around that time I was giving a college friend from Japan around the city and was interested in seeing the High Line so I invited her. The connection I have with the High Line is the memory of the time I spent with my soon to be wife, one of the first moments where I realized these tours were starting to turn into dates.</p> <p>I believe the High Line is a great place to hang out with friends after going to a place like the Chelsea Market located on W 9th ave next to the High Line. Both the beauty of High Line and the great diverse food you can find in the Chelsea Market will assure a good time.</p> <p>I also believe the convenience of already being near Union Square and near so many other landmarks means that it can be a great addition to any day of sightseeing for a group of friends, a couple or a date. The best way to get there would be by taking the subway, there isn't anything specific you need to bring other than some comfortable shoes, a camera or just your phone and a friend.</p>
